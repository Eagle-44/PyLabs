# Some info
### This is the code of lab work for learning Python here is the task.
### Implement the hierarchy of classes representing woodworking machines
### Implement a search for machines by the name of the manufacturer and their purpose (woodworking, sawing, reymus, etc.)
### Implement the possibility of sorting machines by the volume of forest that can machine the machine per hour (in m3) and their capacity (two separate methods)
### The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order
